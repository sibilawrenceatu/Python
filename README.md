# Python Repository
This repository is created for assignment 2 of the IAC Module

# Project Detailed Summary

The goal of this project is to create a feature branch for the Python's exercises carried out for the weeks 2 to 5. This project has completed by following best practices from the Python and Git Hub walkthroughs as specified by the lecturer. A feature branch is created for this project for the purpose of adding additional codes to the feature branch, and merge the feature branch to the main branch. Additional Dev and Test branches were also created by following the best practices in industries as well as the lectuer's notes.   

## **Project Scope**

The project aims to create a new repository "Python" on the student's Git hub account and follow the best practices mentioned by lecturer to merge a feature branch with main branch.  

The project scope involves the following.
1. To establish a folder structure for the python practices from weeks 2 to 5 as specified by the lecturer's notes from weeks 2 to 5 using the GIT CLI (Command line interface) as well as GIT Hub GUI (Graphical User Interface).
2. Copy the practiced programs to this folder structure by making sure all the best practices of python were followed.
3. To briefly outline the functionality of the programs copied.
4. Use Pylint to evaluate the code's quality in the programs.
5. Create a feature branch along with other recommended branches (main, dev and test).
6. Merge the feature branch to the main branch.
7. Include appropriate documentation and comments.

## **Project Status**

There are no outstanding tasks or module restrictions because the project has successfully met all of the outlined goals, which are listed below.

1. A folder structure with exercises created to the GIT Hub using the GIT CLI.
2. All the practiced programs for Python for the weeks 2 to 5 were copied to the folder structure. 
3. The functionality of the codes are briefly explained. 
4. The pylint was run for all the programs to check the code quality. 
5. A feature branch was created along with main, dev and test branches.
6. The feature branch was merged with main branch. 
7. The project includes the appropriate documentation and comments.

## **Getting Started**

### **Code Quality**
The code quality is checked using Pylint throughout the program.

### **Detailed description of the programs**

#### <u>**1. Exercise1 folder:-**</u>
Exercise1 folder contains programs practiced for calculating the student's budget, arithematic operatos calculations, data type identification, and logical comparison operators. The folder also contains string data type programs for immutable check, interpolation, slicing and concatenation.

#### <u>**2. Exercise2 folder:-**</u>
Exercise2 folder contains program for docstring practice.

#### <u>**3. Exercise3 folder:-**</u>
Exercise 3 folder contains practiced programs for list concatenation and nesting. It also contains programs for tuple, dictionary and set data types.

#### <u>**4. Exercise4 folder:-**</u>
Exercise 4 folder contains practiced programs for if statements, loops like for and while. The folder also contains programs for temperature conversion, boolean operators, and program flow statements like break, continue and pass.

#### <u>**5. Exercise5 folder:-**</u>
This folder contains practiced programs for functions, lambda, map, and scope.

#### <u>**6. Exercise6 folder:-**</u>

This folder contains practiced programs for operating system checks and library importing.
