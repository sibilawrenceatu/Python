# Python Repository
This repository is created for assignment 2 of the IAC Module

# Project Detailed Summary

The goal of this project is to create a feature branch named "Newfeatures" for the Python's exercises carried out for the weeks 2 to 5. This project has completed by following best practices from the Python and Git Hub walkthroughs as specified by the lecturer. The "Newfeatures" branch is created for this project for the purpose of adding additional codes to the project, and merge the "Newfeature" branch to the "main" branch. Additionally "Dev", "Bug-Fix" and "Test" branches were also created by following the best practices in industries as well as the lecturer's notes.   

## **Project Scope**

The project aims to create a new repository "Python" on the student's Git hub account and follow the best practices mentioned by lecturer to merge a feature branch named "Newfeatures" with "main" branch.  

The project scope involves the following.
1. To establish a folder structure for the Python practices from weeks 2 to 5 as specified by the lecturer's notes from weeks 2 to 5 using the GIT CLI (Command line interface) as well as GIT Hub GUI (Graphical User Interface).
2. Copy the practiced programs to this folder structure by making sure all the best practices of Python were followed.
3. To briefly outline the functionality of the programs copied.
4. Create a feature branch "Newfeatures" along with other recommended branches (main, dev, Bug-Fix and test).
5. Merge the "Newfeatures" branch to the "main" branch.
6. Include appropriate documentation and comments in the programs as well as readme.md file.

## **Project Status**

There are no outstanding tasks or module restrictions because the project has successfully met all of the outlined goals, which are listed below.

1. A folder structure with exercises created to the GIT Hub using the GIT CLI.
2. All the practiced programs for Python for the weeks 2 to 5 were copied to the folder structure. 
3. The functionality of the codes are briefly explained. 
4. A feature branch was created along with main, Bug-Fix, dev and test branches.
5. The "Newfeature" branch was merged with "main" branch. 
6. The project contains the appropriate documentation and comments in the readme.md file. 

## **Getting Started**

### **Code Quality**
Pylint was used to improve the code quality of programs. All programs were updated with proper comments.

### **Detailed description of the Python programs**

#### <u>**1. Exercise1 folder:-**</u>
Exercise1 folder contains programs practiced for calculating the student's budget, arithematic operatos calculations, data type identification, and logical comparison operators. The folder also contains string data type programs for immutable check, interpolation, slicing and concatenation.

#### <u>**2. Exercise2 folder:-**</u>
Exercise2 folder contains program for docstring practice.

#### <u>**3. Exercise3 folder:-**</u>
Exercise 3 folder contains practiced programs for list concatenation and nesting. It also contains programs for tuple, dictionary and set data types.

#### <u>**4. Exercise4 folder:-**</u>
Exercise 4 folder contains practiced programs for if statements, loops like for and while. The folder also contains programs for temperature conversion, boolean operators, and program flow statements like break, continue and pass.

#### <u>**5. Exercise5 folder:-**</u>
This folder contains practiced programs for functions, lambda, map, and scope.

#### <u>**6. Exercise6 folder:-**</u>

This folder contains practiced programs for operating system checks and library importing. 

#### <u>**7. Exercise7 folder:-**</u>

Exercise 7 contains practiced programs for working directory creation, Diesel endurance calculation, file operation, input validation and raising exception.

#### <u>**8. Exercise8 folder:-**</u>

This folder contains practiced programs for classes.

#### <u>**9. Exercise9 folder:-**</u>

This folder contains practiced programs for pylint.

#### <u>**10. Exercise10 folder:-**</u>

This folder contains practiced programs for cpu log, file utilities, time calculation and OS utilities.

#### <u>**11. Exercise11 folder:-**</u>

This folder contains practiced programs for TCP, UDP, multicast and FTP operations.

#### <u>**12. Exercise12 folder:-**</u>

This folder contains batch script created for building a folder structure.

### **Code Maintenance in Git Hub and History of Execution**

All the codes are saved to Git Hub location https://github.com/sibilawrenceatu/Python.
The project has 5 branches named "main" (where all the final codes are merged and saved from other branches, a "test" branch (this branch is used to test the codes before committing to the main branch), a "dev" branch (used by developers of the project for new developments related to existing project), a "Newfeatures" branch (where new features are developed and merge to the main branch), and a "Bug-Fix" branch which is used to fixing the bugs in the exisitng project and finally merge to the main branch.

The Newfeatures branch was updated with necessary modifications to the comments in the python programs and finally merged to the main branch.
